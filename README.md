I am pleased and very exicited to share my recently completed project: IoT Smart Farming System with Blynk Server üå±üí°

This project integrates IoT technology with agriculture to improve resource efficiency, sustainability, and crop management. Using ESP32, soil moisture, pH, water level, temperature, and humidity sensors, we developed a system that provides:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Real-time monitoring of key environmental parameters

2Ô∏è‚É£ Automated irrigation with pump control

3Ô∏è‚É£ Remote access and alerts through the Blynk IoT platform

4Ô∏è‚É£ Cost-effective and scalable design for future integration

‚úÖ With this system, farmers can monitor and control their fields from any location.
For example, even if you are in Madaripur, you can still take care of your plants at your home in Mohammadpur ‚Äî checking soil conditions, making irrigation decisions, applying fertilizer, and ensuring proper plant care remotely.

Our solution demonstrates how IoT-driven agriculture can address challenges in traditional farming by enabling data-driven decision-making, conserving water, and enhancing productivity.

This work would not have been possible without the dedication of my teammates and the guidance of our supervisor.
